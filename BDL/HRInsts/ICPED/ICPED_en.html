<ol class="para-ol"><li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '2.&ensp;'">Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its competence to exercise jurisdiction over the offence of enforced disappearance when the alleged offender is present in any territory under its jurisdiction, unless it extradites or surrenders him or her to another State in accordance with its international obligations or surrenders him or her to an international criminal tribunal whose jurisdiction it has recognized.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '3.&ensp;'">This Convention does not exclude any additional criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with national law.</li></ol>

The custody and other legal measures shall be as provided for in the law of that State Party but may be maintained only for such time as is necessary to ensure the person's presence at criminal, surrender or extradition proceedings.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '2.&ensp;'">A State Party which has taken the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall immediately carry out a preliminary inquiry or investigations to establish the facts. It shall notify the States Parties referred to in article 9, paragraph 1, of the measures it has taken in pursuance of paragraph 1 of this article, including detention and the circumstances warranting detention, and of the findings of its preliminary inquiry or its investigations, indicating whether it intends to exercise its jurisdiction.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '3.&ensp;'">Any person in custody pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article may communicate immediately with the nearest appropriate representative of the State of which he or she is a national, or, if he or she is a stateless person, with the representative of the State where he or she usually resides.</li></ol>
<h3 class="h3">Article 11</h3>
<ol class="para-ol"><li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '1.&ensp;'">The State Party in the territory under whose jurisdiction a person alleged to have committed an offence of enforced disappearance is found shall, if it does not extradite that person or surrender him or her to another State in accordance with its international obligations or surrender him or her to an international criminal tribunal whose jurisdiction it has recognized, submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '2.&ensp;'">These authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any ordinary offence of a serious nature under the law of that State Party. In the cases referred to in article 9, paragraph 2, the standards of evidence required for prosecution and conviction shall in no way be less stringent than those which apply in the cases referred to in article 9, paragraph 1.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '3.&ensp;'">Any person against whom proceedings are brought in connection with an offence of enforced disappearance shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings.

<h3 class="h3">Article 12</h3>
<ol class="para-ol"><li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '1.&ensp;'">Each State Party shall ensure that any individual who alleges that a person has been subjected to enforced disappearance has the right to report the facts to the competent authorities, which shall examine the allegation promptly and impartially and, where necessary, undertake without delay a thorough and impartial investigation. Appropriate steps shall be taken, where necessary, to ensure that the complainant, witnesses, relatives of the disappeared person and their defence counsel, as well as persons participating in the investigation, are protected against all ill-treatment or intimidation as a consequence of the complaint or any evidence given.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '2.&ensp;'">Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a person has been subjected to enforced disappearance, the authorities referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall undertake an investigation, even if there has been no formal complaint.</li>

<li class="subpara-li-00" style="list-style-type: '(b)'">Have access, if necessary with the prior authorization of a judicial authority, which shall rule promptly on the matter, to any place of detention or any other place where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the disappeared person may be present.</li></ol>
<ol class="para-ol"><li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '4.&ensp;'">Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to prevent and sanction acts that hinder the conduct of an investigation. It shall ensure in particular that persons suspected of having committed an offence of enforced disappearance are not in a position to influence the progress of an investigation by means of pressure or acts of intimidation or reprisal aimed at the complainant, witnesses, relatives of the disappeared person or their defence counsel, or at persons participating in the investigation.</li></ol>
<h3 class="h3">Article 13</h3>
<ol class="para-ol"><li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '1.&ensp;'">For the purposes of extradition between States Parties, the offence of enforced disappearance shall not be regarded as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence or as an offence inspired by political motives. Accordingly, a request for extradition based on such an offence may not be refused on these grounds alone.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '2.&ensp;'">The offence of enforced disappearance shall be deemed to be included as an extraditable offence in any extradition treaty existing between States Parties before the entry into force of this Convention.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '3.&ensp;'">States Parties undertake to include the offence of enforced disappearance as an extraditable offence in any extradition treaty subsequently to be concluded between them.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '4.&ensp;'">If a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty, it may consider this Convention as the necessary legal basis for extradition in respect of the offence of enforced disappearance.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '5.&ensp;'">States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize the offence of enforced disappearance as an extraditable offence between themselves.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '6.&ensp;'">Extradition shall, in all cases, be subject to the conditions provided for by the law of the requested State Party or by applicable extradition treaties, including, in particular, conditions relating to the minimum penalty requirement for extradition and the grounds upon which the requested State Party may refuse extradition or make it subject to certain conditions.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '7.&ensp;'">Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person's sex, race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, political opinions or membership of a particular social group, or that compliance with the request would cause harm to that person for any one of these reasons.</li></ol>
<h3 class="h3">Article 14</h3>
<ol class="para-ol"><li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '1.&ensp;'">States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of mutual legal assistance in connection with criminal proceedings brought in respect of an offence of enforced disappearance, including the supply of all evidence at their disposal that is necessary for the proceedings.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '2.&ensp;'">Such mutual legal assistance shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the domestic law of the requested State Party or by applicable treaties on mutual legal assistance, including, in particular, the conditions in relation to the grounds upon which the requested State Party may refuse to grant mutual legal assistance or may make it subject to conditions.</li></ol>
<h3 class="h3">Article 15</h3>
<p class="para">States Parties shall cooperate with each other and shall afford one another the greatest measure of mutual assistance with a view to assisting victims of enforced disappearance, and in searching for, locating and releasing disappeared persons and, in the event of death, in exhuming and identifying them and returning their remains.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Article 16</h3>
<ol class="para-ol"><li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '1.&ensp;'">No State Party shall expel, return (&ldquo;refouler&rdquo;), surrender or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to enforced disappearance.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '2.&ensp;'">For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations, including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights or of serious violations of international humanitarian law.</li></ol>
<h3 class="h3">Article 17</h3>
<ol class="para-ol"><li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '1.&ensp;'">No one shall be held in secret detention.</li>
