<p class="para"><i>The States Parties to the present Protocol,</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>Encouraged</i>&#x2005;by the overwhelming support for the Convention on the Rights of the Child, demonstrating the widespread commitment that exists to strive for the promotion and protection of the rights of the child,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Reaffirming</i>&#x2005;that the rights of children require special protection, and calling for continuous improvement of the situation of children without distinction, as well as for their development and education in conditions of peace and security,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Disturbed</i>&#x2005;by the harmful and widespread impact of armed conflict on children and the long-term consequences it has for durable peace, security and development,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Condemning</i>&#x2005;the targeting of children in situations of armed conflict and direct attacks on objects protected under international law, including places that generally have a significant presence of children, such as schools and hospitals,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Noting</i>&#x2005;the adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, in particular, the inclusion therein as a war crime, of conscripting or enlisting children under the age of 15 years or using them to participate actively in hostilities in both international and non-international armed conflict,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Considering</i>&#x2005;therefore that to strengthen further the implementation of rights recognized in the Convention on the Rights of the Child there is a need to increase the protection of children from involvement in armed conflict,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Noting</i>&#x2005;that article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child specifies that, for the purposes of that Convention, a child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Convinced</i>&#x2005;that an optional protocol to the Convention that raises the age of possible recruitment of persons into armed forces and their participation in hostilities will contribute effectively to the implementation of the principle that the best interests of the child are to be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Noting</i>&#x2005;that the twenty-sixth International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in December 1995 recommended, inter alia, that parties to conflict take every feasible step to ensure that children below the age of 18 years do not take part in hostilities,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Welcoming</i>&#x2005;the unanimous adoption, in June 1999, of International Labour Organization Convention No. 182 on the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, which prohibits, inter alia, forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Condemning</i>&#x2005;with the gravest concern the recruitment, training and use within and across national borders of children in hostilities by armed groups distinct from the armed forces of a State, and recognizing the responsibility of those who recruit, train and use children in this regard,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Recalling</i>&#x2005;the obligation of each party to an armed conflict to abide by the provisions of international humanitarian law,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Stressing</i>&#x2005;that the present Protocol is without prejudice to the purposes and principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations, including Article 51, and relevant norms of humanitarian law,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Bearing</i>&#x2005;in mind that conditions of peace and security based on full respect of the purposes and principles contained in the Charter and observance of applicable human rights instruments are indispensable for the full protection of children, in particular during armed conflict and foreign occupation,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Recognizing</i>&#x2005;the special needs of those children who are particularly vulnerable to recruitment or use in hostilities contrary to the present Protocol owing to their economic or social status or gender,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Mindful</i>&#x2005;of the necessity of taking into consideration the economic, social and political root causes of the involvement of children in armed conflict,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Convinced</i>&#x2005;of the need to strengthen international cooperation in the implementation of the present Protocol, as well as the physical and psychosocial rehabilitation and social reintegration of children who are victims of armed conflict,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Encouraging</i>&#x2005;the participation of the community and, in particular, children and child victims in the dissemination of informational and educational programmes concerning the implementation of the Protocol,</p>
<p class="para"><i>Have agreed</i>&#x2005;as follows:</p>

<h3 class="h3">Article 3</h3>
<ol class="para-ol"><li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '1.&ensp;'">States Parties shall raise the minimum age for the voluntary recruitment of persons into their national armed forces from that set out in article 38, paragraph 3, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, taking account of the principles contained in that article and recognizing that under the Convention persons under the age of 18 years are entitled to special protection.</li>

<li class="subpara-li-00" style="list-style-type: 'c.'">Such persons are fully informed of the duties involved in such military service;</li>

<h3 class="h3">Article 7</h3>
<ol class="para-ol"><li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '1.&ensp;'">States Parties shall cooperate in the implementation of the present Protocol, including in the prevention of any activity contrary thereto and in the rehabilitation and social reintegration of persons who are victims of acts contrary thereto, including through technical cooperation and financial assistance. Such assistance and cooperation will be undertaken in consultation with the States Parties concerned and the relevant international organizations.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '2.&ensp;'">States Parties in a position to do so shall provide such assistance through existing multilateral, bilateral or other programmes or, inter alia, through a voluntary fund established in accordance with the rules of the General Assembly.</li></ol>
<h3 class="h3">Article 8</h3>
<ol class="para-ol"><li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '1.&ensp;'">Each State Party shall, within two years following the entry into force of the present Protocol for that State Party, submit a report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child providing comprehensive information on the measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the Protocol, including the measures taken to implement the provisions on participation and recruitment.</li>
<li class="para-li" style="list-style-type: '2.&ensp;'">Following the submission of the comprehensive report, each State Party shall include in the reports it submits to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in accordance with article 44 of the Convention, any further information with respect to the implementation of the Protocol.
